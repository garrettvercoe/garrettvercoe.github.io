Professional, business, health and education services make up 60% of the D.C. economy, with a declining unemployment rate at 6.1% and 60,500 jobs added to the market in just the last year.2 53% of the labor force holds a bachelor’s degree, with an average per capita income of $46,500.1 Home of the federal government, Washington D.C. also attracts a lot of tourism and federal jobs which help in boosting the local economy. National monuments, museums, entertainment venues, and lots of green space help in making this capital one many enjoy. However, what other interesting aspects to the city are there?\nThe poverty line in D.C. is 17.3%, a 3 percent higher rate than the national average. There is a racial minority majority, with the largest race group being African Americans, totaling 48.3% of the population.1 (See Exhibit 2.)

(See Exhibit 1.) Thus a major aspect of D.C.’s future community planning is how to best account for this population change. This huge growth rate in the population is a double-edged sword from an urban planning perspective. On one hand, this growth can cause housing projects and businesses to expand outside of the concentrated central and northwest D.C wealthy areas and spread across the city. This growing population can also increase the urban density, which could eliminate the need for cars and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the area.7\nHowever, this population growth also has caused housing prices to skyrocket over the past ten years. This rise in housing costs has been accompanied by salaries remaining largely the same, and new building projects are not featuring affordable housing.8 This has caused D.C.’s poverty rate to be growing while other cities are experiencing declining poverty rates such as New Orleans and Salt Lake City.9 Affordable housing has become a paramount issue due to this heavy growth."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Transit has also been heavily affected recently by population changes in the district.

In D.C. there are fewer families and more single-resident households than in the past, with the average resident-per-household in the city at 2.22 people.1 Where will this new population live in the city when building development is so heavily regulated?\nFurthermore, D.C. recognizes the huge issue of global warming and how urban planning can both adapt and mitigate this damage to the environment. The capital is looking into ways to be more sustainable while still having a high-functioning city. Planners have to face the issues of more severe storms, raising in sea levels, and possible compromises to the city’s infrastructure.12 By facing these challenges they are adapting to climate change. However, D.C. is also looking to make strides in mitigating climate change, but planners have to find the most effective way for the rest of the city to adopt these green policies."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-link"],"href":"/static/bf10d0ca2bb4525aeb32a628a5b5dda5/e446d/exhibit2.jpg","style":"display: block","target":"_blank","rel":["noopener"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"],"style":"position: relative; display: block; margins: 0 20px 0 20px max-width: 412px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-background-image"],"style":"padding-bottom: 61.6504854368932%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBBAX/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHaTaUOJD//xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAEDERL/2gAIAQEAAQUC0Xg0lTnOwZAXP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECEBEAElH/2gAIAQEABj8CLcxQaOwm1Wo//8QAGRABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREAECFB/9oACAEBAAE/IbIKCwxyAoTzSB0uLhJ1/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBjD//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8QP//EABoQAQEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExEFH/2gAIAQEAAT8QNGOki8xCTq0UF3vZhzGgQRES0e4bApasPheHn//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-image"],"style":"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;","alt":"exhibit2","title":"","src":"/static/bf10d0ca2bb4525aeb32a628a5b5dda5/e446d/exhibit2.jpg","srcSet":["/static/bf10d0ca2bb4525aeb32a628a5b5dda5/576d5/exhibit2.jpg 270w","/static/bf10d0ca2bb4525aeb32a628a5b5dda5/e446d/exhibit2.jpg 412w"],"sizes":["(max-width:","412px)","100vw,","412px"]},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Setbacks to city planning"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With all these problems for planners, there are a lot of setbacks as well.

Chapter 25 of this plan goes into depth about the implementation of the comprehensive plan. One main implementation strategy is holding small-area planning committees across the district to make assure that progress is on track. Planners also realized that the comprehensive plan had to be a long-range plan if it were to ever be fully administered. Accounting for the future is one of the the central ways in which D.C. hopes to maintain the implementation of its comprehensive plan.15 The District government also gives an annual capital improvements budget, and the comprehensive plan seeks to have its major issues featured within that budget so implementation can be maintained.4 Furthermore, the comprehensive plan is intended to be updated every four years, with a major revision every 12 years to make sure long-term planning is proceeding as intended.

This development regulation has given D.C. a unique look compared to other cities in the country.16 The height limit has created an open feel to the city, a refreshing alternative to the feeling of being cloistered off by tall buildings alongside narrow avenues experienced in other major U.S. cities. This regulation further enhances the historic feel to the city, and helps prevent an urban heat island effect.

New building development, especially those near alternative transportation options, will be allowed less space for parking which should bolster alternative transportation modes as well as the availability for lower cost housing. Corner grocery stores in residential areas have now been allowed as well, which should help lower food insecurity in the city. The zoning of the downtown area has also been expanded to encompass the riverfront and other high density areas nearby.5 The zoning regulations feature a good amount of high density commercial land use in the downtown area with a fair amount of mixed use high-density residential and commercial areas.

D.C. is ranked 6th in the country for cities with the most park accessibility, with 96% of residents being within a 10 minute walk to a park. Nearly 20% of the district is parkland.19 I think this is critical to the success of the city. The park spaces create a community space where people can freely interact.

Cohousing would be able to create more dense communities while still maintaining the building height regulations. Inclusionary zoning would allow more housing opportunity to the lower income of the community and help intermingle the different economic groups of the city. Transit options are constantly improving such as the introduction of the streetcar in 2013, but the metro needs a revamp with better pricing and new revenue models if it hopes to retain users.6 Overall, the city is on the right track to sustainability, but needs extra pushing by the public for more transit-oriented development alongside more affordable housing."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-link"],"href":"/static/96662e50093fb0d66235236609deb3fb/8e087/exhibit8.jpg","style":"display: block","target":"_blank","rel":["noopener"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"],"style":"position: relative; display: block; margins: 0 20px 0 20px max-width: 594px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-background-image"],"style":"padding-bottom: 33.16498316498316%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-image"],"style":"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;","alt":"exhibit8","title":"","src":"/static/96662e50093fb0d66235236609deb3fb/8e087/exhibit8.jpg","srcSet":["/static/96662e50093fb0d66235236609deb3fb/a4f4e/exhibit8.jpg 270w","/static/96662e50093fb0d66235236609deb3fb/77baa/exhibit8.jpg 540w","/static/96662e50093fb0d66235236609deb3fb/8e087/exhibit8.jpg 594w"],"sizes":["(max-width:","594px)","100vw,","594px"]},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusion"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The city has come a long way since it was planned in 1791.
