During this period, the role of the architect began to form, efforts were enacted to standardize architecture through canon documents, and the relationship between tradition and innovation began to be fleshed out both through writings and the built environment. In this paper, I will show how tradition and innovation were interacted between, specifically within the realms of the Ottoman Empire and Italy through the works of architects Sinan and Alberti. As reference, I will examine Gulru Necipoglu’s argument towards this theme and expand upon it. My essay will identify that the Ottoman Empire and Italy incorporate tradition and translate it to innovation through very different methods, due to their differing ideas of how to interact with tradition."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans, they inherited a Catholic land. The Byzantine Hagia Sophia loomed in their faces, questioning their Islamic religion through its own grandeur. Sinan in his autobiography discusses how the Christian Europeans boasted that they “have scored a victory over the Muslims” as “no dome as large as that of Hagia Sophia had been built in the lands of Islam” (Sinan, from Ruggles 143–144). Sinan then took it upon himself to build a dome and structure greater than that of the Hagia Sophia, which became the Selimiye Mosque. This interaction shows the competitive nature of architecture in the early modern period but also the competition between past and current architectural works."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-link"],"href":"/static/ded450d134a52b5befa3eda1bbd29835/78f29/Picture1.jpg","style":"display: block","target":"_blank","rel":["noopener"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"],"style":"position: relative;

How does this clear similarity show innovation upon Sinan’s part? Gulru Necipoglu in her analysis of early modern Islamic architecture argues that these works often “allude to the past in order to challenge it and to affirm the superiority of their own time” (Necipoglu 170). Sinan in the Selimiye Mosque takes characteristics of the Hagia Sophia, but improves upon them both as a testament to the past but as a statement for how the modern time is better. In this example, Sinan takes the dome characteristics of the Byzantine structure and creates a Neo-Hagia Sophian, Ottoman styled building with a clearer pyramidal hierarchy, greater contrast of cubic and spherical elements, as well as a greater emphasis on the dematerialization of the exterior to match the interior elements (Necipoglu 172, 174). By taking these characteristics of the Byzantine structure, Sinan shows how modern Islam is superior than the past and the non-Islamic. Necipoglu also brings up a notable point through her analysis of Sinan, “[he] did not, however, make the architecture of Hagia Sophia his point of departure, but filtered its lessons through the accumulated heritage of Ottoman-Islamic architecture” (Necipoglu 173). Sinan did not reject tradition, rather he learned from it and reinterpreted those building traditions."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"During this same time the Italians were undergoing a Renaissance, and they were also looking to the past for architectural innovation. There was a Greco-Roman architectural revival occurring. Similar to Sinan, Italian architects knew of their innovations but still relied on architect exemplars of the past to base their originality off of (Necipoglu 173). Alberti in “On the Art of Building in 10 Books” looks back to the Roman Vitruvius in detailing what good architecture is and how it is based off of beauty, utility, and structural integrity. Furthermore, he declares buildings should be in line with that of Greco-Roman preferences such as that of having sober exterior decoration. Alberti in his buildings exemplifies his writing and alludes to past Greco-Roman structures."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-link"],"href":"/static/1a3030dedbd721e84ef0d10247eb128c/15958/Picture3.jpg","style":"display: block","target":"_blank","rel":["noopener"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"],"style":"position: relative;

The Italians choose and reject what aspects of their history they want to make their tradition, while the Ottoman’s accept all of Islamic history as tradition.
