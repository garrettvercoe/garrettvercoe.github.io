There has begun this ideal archetype of the American who has a stable career and has a family with kids in a mid-to-upper sized suburban home. Two stories, three bedrooms, 2000 square feet: it sounds nice, doesn’t it? [1] Well, maybe at one point. There has been a shift of perspective recently where this image of home brings to mind ideas of stagnation, mortgages, and a shackling down of adventure. In the past several years, a new movement has emerged labelled the “Tiny House Movement”. It has garnered several T.V. shows, a featuring on countless news channels, and has pushed to redefine the American definition of a home.[2] While many see this movement as only occurring within the last several years, this exhibit seeks to showcase the roots of this movement and how it is actually an old ideology rather than a new one. The tiny home has pushed the American Dream of the present to the one of the past with an incorporation of ideas of self-sustainment, the frontier, and a connection with nature."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-link"],"href":"/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/ce2ac/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg","style":"display: block","target":"_blank","rel":["noopener"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"],"style":"position: relative; display: block; margins: 0 20px 0 20px; max-width: 1080px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-background-image"],"style":"padding-bottom: 66.6722972972973%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"className":["gatsby-resp-image-image"],"style":"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;","alt":"unsplash.com","title":"","src":"/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/61d2b/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg","srcSet":["/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/c293e/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 270w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/cff0d/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 540w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/61d2b/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 1080w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/5fc58/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 1620w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/162aa/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 2160w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/1f321/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 3240w","/static/a227986aec5a2f42494fe3055ad5d9b8/ce2ac/fabian-mardi-538249-unsplash.jpg 5920w"],"sizes":["(max-width:","1080px)","100vw,","1080px"]},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  "}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Architecture integrally relates to the social, political, and economic conditions of a space.

Through this writing he tells his story of living near Walden Pond in Massachusetts, a simple life supported by no one other than himself. He explains the importance of a simple living and a deep connection with nature to rejuvenate the soul. “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.”[3] This book, published in 1854, helped establish the American value on living through self-sufficiency.[4]"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This value on a simple, self-sufficient life however did not begin with this story by the pond. It is the natural history of humans. History and especially American history was raised on the backs of farmers and frontiersmen. Life has been predicated on a rural framework, the idea of getting away from the urban landscape and making a tiny home isn’t that old of a notion. The tiny home used to be a societal norm.[5] The log cabins featured in this exhibit display that succinctly. These “tiny homes” were not anything special during the day. They were created by those needing a temporary space to live while on the move. Through the politics of Jackson and Harrison the log cabin was associated with the “common man”. Only in the past two hundred years has a tiny home became a rebellion to cultural norms, largely due to the results of industrialization.[6]"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As technology advanced further it became more affordable to have a larger space in which to live. Two men named John Ruskin and William Morris living during the start of this machine age warned of how it may ruin the quality of the home.

The home became a thing to impress others with. It was almost no longer for those who were inside it, but those who viewed it from the outside. More and more rooms started to get added to the home, all as a reach to show a family’s economic prowess.7 The tiny home of today originates as lash back from this suburban crisis. A tiny house was associated with poverty rather than a focus in detail. Sarah Susanka released the “Not So Big House” in 1998 that helped put these worries into words, and she helped redefine the small house as not an impoverished condition but rather an attention to the inhabitants of the home and maximizing enjoyment with the space they are given."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Though Susanka’s work is one of the main precedents of the movement today, it took quite some time to catch on. It wasn’t until the Great Recession of 2008 that the not so big house became a priority. Many millennials as they were about to enter the job force saw their parents struggle to pay their mortgages and other finances. The increasing debt of college tuition weighed on their heads and many decided to go into a tiny home where they wouldn’t have a mortgage and could very well lived where they pleased.[8]"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Alongside the economic conditions of the time, there began a growing interest in sustainability. Climate change became more and more a pressing issue and millennials felt as if they didn’t want to contribute to the making of this problem. The idea of a cheap house with a small environmental footprint suddenly became satisfying. Those millennials growing up during the time of the suburban “McMansions” realized the wastefulness of such a large abode. The size of the average home doubled between 1950 and 2012,[9] yet that space was rarely being used. A 2015 psychology study found that the home influences a person’s emotional state and it reflects the social interactions and power dynamics that are played out within the home.[10] Thus, the stress of parents going through the Great Recession naturally became applied to the idea of those large suburban homes for millennials."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Millennials went into action. The amount of tiny homes went from a couples hundred to over 10,000 in just a couple years.[12] However, after some time millennials no longer became the primary group of tiny house owners. Now 40% of tiny home owners are over 50 years of age, with an average house size of 186 sq. feet. And the group seems to be on track with what they set out to do. 55% of tiny house owners have more savings than the average American, 89% have less credit card than the average American, and 68% of tiny house people have no mortgage whatsoever. [13] Tiny living has become “trendy” as it is now associated with this financial mobility and sustainable lifestyle. It has taken on the ideas of Thoreau with living self-sufficiently and having a deep connection to nature. This exhibit will showcase an interactive walk through time of how those values of the tiny house movement have popped up over history. Through the efforts of this exhibit, it is hoped that more discussion will occur between large and small living, and that more people can learn about the tiny house movement that is occurring under many people’s noses."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bibliography"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Benitez, Cristina Paredes., and Alex Sanchez.
